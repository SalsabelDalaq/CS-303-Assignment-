# Instructions for Running the Code

This will execute the main program, which interacts with the user to perform various operations on an integer array.

## Usage

Follow the on-screen prompts to perform the following operations:
- Checking if a number exists in the array.
- Modifying the value of an integer in the array.
- Adding a new integer to the end of the array.
- Removing an integer from the array.

## Additional Notes

- The code assumes that there is a "data.txt" file in the same directory, which contains integer values separated by spaces. This file is used to initialize the array.
- Error handling is implemented for user inputs and file opening errors.

Feel free to explore the code and modify it as needed for your own purposes.
